This lecture provides a framework that equips students with the necessary tools to critically engage with digital content. Furthermore, it would bridge their understanding of visual rhetoric and the following assignment that requires them to do a [rhetorical analysis](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/digital-rhetoric/) of a social media post, critically examining how visual elements can influence public perception in the digital age.

## Transcript

How frequently do you check social media every day, and what platforms are you usually on? Here is an X post from Jaxxon Sterling, a 22-year-old pop star known for his chaotic energy and chart-topping hits. This is a fictional X post created by Gemini 3 Pro Image, but you may be familiar with how Jax uses informal language, including emojis and memes, to express his everyday political concerns about a recent ban on electric scooters in the downtown area by the city council.

This example sheds light on the notion of "digital rhetoric," a term first coined by Lanham in 1992 to consider reading and writing as electronic rather than print, on screen rather than on paper, and visually complicated rather than as "pure words." As rhetoricians have established over the past three decades, "digital rhetoric" pertains to at least 6 key aspects: pervasiveness, materiality, visuality, multimodality, inner working, and vernacular culture.

1. Pervasiveness

Digital communication is so pervasive today that it has become the "default" mode of writing and turning in essays for college students. Digital technologies don't necessarily jeopardize or salvage languages. Rather, they transform our ways of reading and writing in a computational and networked world, while being constantly reshaped by our practices.

2. Materiality, or Interface/Screen

Just like print culture emerged with specific material conditions, various technological advances enabled digital rhetoric. Theorists are fascinated by the electronic "interface" that mediates our corporeal existence and the virtual world. As we send and receive real-time responses, feel the vibes of the world through "trending topics," and shift the train of life triggered by push alerts... the "small screens" of our personal devices become the embodied, immersive condition in which we experience digital rhetoric.

3. Visuality

If the first two sound too abstract, they lay the cornerstone for understanding the analytical categories of digital rhetoric. In our previous sessions, we reiterated that visuals tell their stories better than words. The naturalization of computer and television screens in our work and personal lives is the classic example. On the first day of its perception, "digital rhetoric" was almost the equivalent of the visual logics of digital genres.

4. Multimodality

Just like you, rhetoricians quickly picked up the multimodal, or multisensory, modes of knowing: sound, hyperlinks, videos, moving pictures, memes... all rhetorical tools that strengthen the argument of immersiveness. Multimodality is not monopolized by digital rhetoric. Yet, it epitomizes multisensory persuasion precisely because of how entrenched it is in our surroundings.

5. Inner workings, such as code, algorithms, and communication infrastructure

Digital scholars have reminded us about the human biases built into the algorithms that determine what achieves more visibility and credibility. Moreover, platform-specific affordances may have become so invisible that we intuitively accept the constraints of publishing and viewing content only in certain formats, the scroll-based consumption that fragments longer arguments into digestible pieces, and the engagement mechanics such as liking, sharing, and commenting that shape our understanding of participation and social influence.

6. Vernacular culture

Of course, we're never blind recipients of digital rhetoric, regardless of our capacity to code. Instead, studies on online participatory and convergence cultures show that we actively create digital communities and vernacular cultures, developing unique languages that may seem odd to outsiders. At the same time, just like visual rhetoric is mediated by visual literacy, knowing about digital rhetoric raises questions about digital literacy, which depends on a person's financial, cultural, and educational background, highlighting issues of inequality.

These aspects connects to our coming assignment, which requires you to examine the digital rhetoric of a social media post. On one hand, modes of rhetorical analysis we've learned before remain applicable in these new contexts. Back to Jax's post. The way it's put together and the images used still show certain exigencies, audiences, and constraints while also expressing specific types of credibility, emotional appeal, and logical arguments. At the same time, note the "2.4M Views" displayed in this picture; this program-generated popularity metric conveys a visual message to readers who are experienced in social media cultures: It indicates how widely this message has disseminated and, as a ripple effect, how convincing it is to the audience that resonates with it and buys Jax's rhetoric. It's possible, then, that this post ended up much more socially influential than a 100-page report on the same issue.
