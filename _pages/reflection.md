This is the second semester where I teach college students as a (relatively) independent instructor. I did teach pre-higher ed students Chinese reading and writing in Hong Kong long before, though, and sure there were transferable skills, but they seem to be distant stories that resist direct transplantation. As a result, rather than deriving a consistent philosophy from past teaching experiences and gleaning relevant evidence, curating this digital teaching portfolio becomes more of a reflexive process of articulating my pedagogies on the move. Institutional support, namely the weekly meetings with Josh from the WRD program and workshops from CELT, has been instructive in providing solid foundations and collaborative opportunities to apply approaches as I learn them, such as the [challenging encounter with students and GenAI in the classroom](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/writing-technology/). With the conscious knowledge that the outcome assumes a utilitarian role, i.e., a key material in applying for a teaching-related job, the teaching portfolio nevertheless embodies a process-oriented writing that explores the ideal figure of a teacher I wish to become.

"Scaffolding" is the keyword here. Before coming to the UK I wrote in my teaching statement, "the most crucial aspect of teaching is to clearly communicate the desired learning outcomes for each lesson and all instructional designs." Yet time and again, my students and observers have told me that the content might be too difficult, the questions could be more approachable, the session might be too packed, and I might be too demanding. These comments reflect none of my intentions, yet I struggle to balance between the right amount of instructions for students to understand and application activities for them to process. Structures from WRD and particularly my mentor have been helpful, as the syllabus allows not only my students but also me to unpack and develop the learning experience across the semester.

This journey together with the digital teaching portfolio becomes a pedagogical practice for me.I found myself returning to my research interest that connects to the students—the digital—and the imperative of scaffolding as tasks arose. This approach became most evident in designing the [rhetoric assignment](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/digital-rhetoric/) and [teaching demo](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/teaching-demo/). While I imagined the assignment to be an integrated application of rhetorical analysis for students after learning visual rhetoric, I soon realized that their current textbook may use the aid of an extra lecture on specifically digital rhetoric, even though the chapter on visual rhetoric has addressed misinformation and disinformation. This semester of independent teaching has transformed my pedagogical approach from content-focused instruction to scaffolded learning design, revealing that effective teaching requires not just clear communication of outcomes but thoughtful progression of skills and concepts. Through institutional mentorship and reflective portfolio development, I've learned to balance academic rigor with accessible instruction, particularly when integrating students' digital experiences with formal rhetorical analysis.
