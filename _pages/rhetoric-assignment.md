## Prompt

In an increasingly digitally connected world, our understanding of rhetorics have also undergone rapid changes subject to the advancement of communication technologies and rhetors' evolving use of them, as a 280-character Twitter/X post can be as effective, if not more, than a 20-page peer-reviewed article. This assignment requires you to select a publicly available social media post from a celebrity, be they politicians, athletes, artists, influencers, etc. Setting the source from a celebrity attempts to minimize the ethical issues of extracting others' digital traces without prior permission. The post can be from any commonly used platform, such as Twitter/X, Facebook/Meta, Instagram (including stories), and Tiktok. Use 600-750 words to address the following prompts. Making sure the chosen post taps into a public issue or at least stirred a public debate will aid your analysis, but it is not compulsory. The language can be formal or informal, as long as you can clearly articulate your points.

## Requirement

1. Explain the context(s) and message of the post. Why did the celebrity make that post? Who were the intended or imagined audience (You can also speculate from their follower base and the actual reception)? And what were the possible constraints of that post? (Modeled after your rhetorical blog 2)
2. How does the post exemplify or deviates from the celebrity's typical style in the way how they present themselves, mobilize emotions, and argue their case? (Modeled after your rhetoricla blog 3)
3. How did the celebrity utilize the platform-specific visual and digital rhetorical instruments? You can discuss the medium (texts, photos, videos, audios...). You should also pay attention to how the technological functions enable (and sometimes, intentionally block) certain forms of communication, such as through liking, commenting, forwarding, and inserting links.

## Format

1. Include a screenshot of the post you are analyzing.
2. Include a brief introduction and conclusion.
3. Header on the first page only (name, date, class, professor name)
4. Page number, times new roman, 12 pt, 1-inch margin
5. Double-spaced
6. MLA citation (link to how to cite social media posts)

## Note

This assignment should be situated after students have learnt about visual rhetoric and [digital rhetoric](/_teaching/teaching-demo.md) . Early on in the semester, they have discussed the exigence, audience, and constraints of a written text (rhetorical blog 2, ard 330 words), and the ethos, pathos, logos of the same text (rhetorical blog 3, ard 330 words). This assignment requires students to write a comprehensive short paper to synthesize these ideas while expanding on the concepts of visual and digital rhetoric. As the assignment assumes the use of social media is entrenched in students' everyday lives, this design allows them to examine the materials that most interest them with wider range of diversity while adopting a fresh eye to social media content through the lens of rhetoric.
