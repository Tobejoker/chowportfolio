Welcome to my Digital Teaching Portfolio for ENG609-001 (Fall 2025). This site serves as a showcase of my teaching philosophy, rhetorical assignment, and digital teaching demonstration completed for the course. It reflects my commitment to integrating technology into education and fostering an engaging learning environment. Explore the sections below to learn more about my approach and experiences in teaching.

## Philosophy of Teaching

Communication is an essential part of social and political life. Teaching writing in higher education therefore carries political stakes in every aspect. I start designing my syllabus with the purpose of nurturing citizens and professionals, encouraging the class to engage with writing with social awareness. As an educator, I try to bridge my transnational expertise with students’ intimate experiences. For example, I have asked my students to discuss the social media ban on teenagers in Australia, a topic that allowed them to draw on personal experiences while critically engaging with social issues through both of their distinct voices and [rhetorical situations](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/teaching-demo/).

To develop students’ unique voices, I ask my students to start with details, specificities, and contextualization when they encounter big theories. On one hand, this constant practice gives students room for originality and creativity, helping them express and develop unique writing styles. I hope students can delve into projects that suit their interests and create writing they would proudly share with their families and friends. On the other hand, language and rhetoric carry inherent biases, even in non-human-generated content by [GenAI models](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/writing-technology/). Analyzing texts grounded in their contexts will allow students to adopt a justice-oriented approach to reading and writing, a skill indispensable to their intellectual and professional endeavors.

Working with diverse students has taught me that the most crucial aspect of teaching is to clearly communicate the desired learning outcomes for each lesson and all instructional designs. One valuable approach I increasingly rely on is [project scaffolding](https://tobejoker.github.io/chowportfolio/digital-rhetoric/) through such tasks as research proposals, annotated bibliographies, and peer reviews. This way, my students do not need to be “perfect” writers or researchers. Instead, we treat writing as a creative process while working toward clear goals. By focusing on these manageable steps, I find it easier to adjust my delivery and create engaging activities based on the specific needs and conditions of each classroom. Through this student-centered approach and regular assessment of their progress, I strive to ensure that each student can achieve their full potential.

This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
