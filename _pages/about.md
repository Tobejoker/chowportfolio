Welcome to my Digital Teaching Portfolio for ENG609-001 (Fall 2025). This site serves as a showcase of my teaching philosophy, rhetorical assignment, and digital teaching demonstration completed for the course. It reflects my commitment to integrating technology into education and fostering an engaging learning environment. Explore the sections below to learn more about my approach and experiences in teaching.

## Tech Credit

This website is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. Incidentally, these same features make it a great template for anyone that needs to show off a professional template!

 You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and Markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!
